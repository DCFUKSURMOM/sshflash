# sshflash
Software to flash leapfrog device firmware over SSH.

To flash the full firmware use remote_flash.sh

To flash just the kernel use kernel-flash.sh (recommended to ssh in and copy kernel modules after)

To just boot surgeon and automatically ssh into the device with important partitions mounted, use boot_surgeon.sh
